# The Minimal Ethical Code (MEC) Initiative

**Motto:** "Ethics become real when they can be implemented."

## Vision: A Universal Standard for Trustworthy AI

The Minimal Ethical Code (MEC) is a proposal for a universal technical and legal standard for the governance of Artificial Intelligence. Its mission is to build a shared global infrastructure of safety, accountability, and transparency.

This repository hosts the official documents and serves as the central hub for the global conversation around the MEC Initiative.
